The game works taking commands inputted by the user.

Anything you type in the text-box is a “command” (e.g. “talk to the treant”).
Every time you type a command in the box and you press enter your command is processed and the appropriate text is displayed in the text area (e.g. if you type “go north” in the text area will appear the description of the area you moved into).
Commands within the game can change, so if you pick up a new Item that will allow you to perform a new action the command will be made available (e.g. if you pick up a key you will then be able to use the command “open”).

###### Commands:

Those listed below are the available commands when you start the game, other commands might be discovered and made available while playing the game.

There is a **help** command that shows all the available commands.

The **go** command allows you to move around in all the different areas of the map, it has to be used together with the direction you want to take (e.g. “go south”).

The **examine** command lets you examine an item or a character showing its description. 
If that item is of the class of items that cannot be picked up it could contain other items that will be shown and made available to pick up once the item has been examined.
If the item is a weapon its specs would also be displayed (e.g. damage, miss rate etc.).
This command can be used by itself to examine the area you are in or  together with the item/character you want to examine (e.g. “examine wardrobe”)
